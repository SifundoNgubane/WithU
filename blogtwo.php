                <p class="blog-page-desc ">
                In South Africa, many underprivileged school girls miss school during their periods because they do not have sanitary pads.

The lack of access to sanitary pads for school girls who are financially disadvantaged touched the hearts of students in the Faculty of Economic and Management Sciences (EMS) and prompted them to step in and assist.

On 27 May 2022, The BAdmin@TukS and Tax@Tuks donated over 400 packs of sanitary pads in aid of underprivileged school girls at Tswaing Secondary School in Winterveld, Pretoria.

The donation came following a discussion with one of the teachers at the school who mentioned that the majority of the school girls did not have access to sanitary products. According to Courtney Smith, Chairperson of BAdmin@tuks, another teacher said the lack of access became apparent when the school’s drainage system was blocked with newspapers, which the girls were using as an alternative to sanitary pads. The problem still persists as the school’s drainage needs to be unblocked every few months. The donation will also help prevent the blockage.

Gloria Khoza, Commercii’s Outreach Officer and former learner at Tswaing Secondary School who was amongst the EMS students who delivered the donation, said she realised there was a huge need for sanitary pads at schools in Winterveld after she witnessed an underprivileged girl being humiliated for using tissue as a sanitary pad.

We sometimes forget how privileged we are to be able to carry on with our daily lives because we have access to sanitary products, while many underprivileged girls miss days of school because of something that they have no control over,” says Smith.</p>
